When I ran the program 10 times with all choices (single thread, 100 threads, 1000 threads) it appeared that on average there is a fine line between the threads being helpful and the overhead of creating too many threads making the program run longer. On average, the 100 thread implementation was faster followed by the single thread with the 1000 thread implementation taking the longest time to run.
